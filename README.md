# Entity Component System

This repo is a game I made in my 2nd semester of university for the subject "Object-Oriented Programming".

It's a clone of the game Defend Your Castle on xgenstudios.com.

It's written in an Entity-Component-System architecture which is an extreme version of the Component Pattern where data and functionality are entirely segregated.
